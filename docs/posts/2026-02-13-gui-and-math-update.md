title: Gui and Math update
date: 2026-02-13

I have gotten som help with polishing the math, and I am more confident in that the right calculations are made. However, there are issues still. The further back I move, while still aiming the gun straight, the further down the aim line goes. This should stay at the same height. The same goes for aiming side to side. 

The second issue I suspect is becuase the the fish eye distortion of the camera lese isn't fully removed by the camera calibration. I will redo the calibration in the future.

I also updated to GUI to include all views into the same window. This limits the camera fps, however. Also, the view might seems mirrored, and it takes me a bit before it clicks what the graphs show.

The next step is to fix the issues and increse the reliability of the aim.
